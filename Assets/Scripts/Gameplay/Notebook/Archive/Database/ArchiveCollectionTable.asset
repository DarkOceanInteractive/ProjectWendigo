    Description: Ah, the weird-looking trophy she got from that science project.
      We stayed up all night that day, working on it. At the end, that little genius
      didn't even need my help. She said she wanted me to keep it, that she couldn't
      have done it without me... If only she knew herself what she is capable of.

    Description: Her first stuffed doll. She was so scared of the dark when she was
      little that I had to stay in her room until she fell asleep. After I gave it
      to her, she would not let go of it or leave it out of her sight for even a
      minute. She felt safe because I told her it would protect her from the monsters
      in her dreams.. I wish I could see that smile she had oh her face when I told
      her she wouldn't have anymore nightmares.
